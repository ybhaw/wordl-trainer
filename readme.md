> **Notes**
> * This tool was created with a good conscience, to programmatically & analytically solve wordl problem statement. Please don't use this tool in a way that gives you any form of competitive advantage.
> * The dictionary I used contained many words that are not found in many platoforms, you may have to try a different word from suggestions depending on platform that you are playing on.
